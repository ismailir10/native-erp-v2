# Testing with real client statements

Real bank statements are client data (NDA, UU PDP). This page says where they may go and how to take one from
file to a closed month.

## Rules
1. There is **one workspace** ([ADR 0008](adrs/0008-one-workspace.md)). Real client work lives in production (https://native-erp-v2.vercel.app),
   behind invitation-only login, on Supabase project `native-erp-v2` with `DEMO_MODE=false`. It is the only hosted environment ([ADR 0015](adrs/0015-production-only.md)).
2. Real data lives in exactly two places:
   - **Local**: Postgres on your machine. Files go in `data/private/` (gitignored).
   - **Production**: the workspace above. No demo firm and no reset. Never point `demo:reset` at its database.
3. Never commit a statement, a screenshot of one, or `inspect:statement` output. Tests use synthetic fixtures (`tests/pdf-fixture.ts`).
4. With an AI key set, *unrecognised* lines go to the AI gateway (OpenCode Zen): the merchant key, the first 80 characters
   of the description, and the client's name and business type. Lines matched by transfers, rules or memory are never sent.
   Leave the key empty for rules-only.
5. The authenticated [evidence workspace](evidence-workspace.md) can send bounded source passages to AI for explicitly requested context proposals and question planning. This is broader than merchant/account-name classification above; source files and citations remain private.
6. PDF passwords are used once to open the file. They're never stored or logged.

## 1. Check the file before importing (no database)
```bash
npm run inspect:statement -- data/private/bca-agustus.pdf
PDF_PASSWORD=01011980 npm run inspect:statement -- data/private/mandiri.pdf   # password-protected PDF
npm run inspect:statement -- data/private/bri.pdf --lines                       # raw PDF text with x positions
npm run inspect:statement -- data/private/belifi-mei-juli.xls --year=2026       # dates without a year (dd/MM)
```
Look for `Kesinambungan NYAMBUNG ✓`. That means opening + every row = every printed balance = closing, so no row was
lost or misread. `ADA CELAH ✗` names the broken rows. Exit code 2 means a gap.

Supported: **25 Indonesian banks** and the formats each one exports — the list, with how Buku knows each layout (`REAL` file,
`PUBLISHED` by the bank or public parser code, `INFERRED` common layout), lives in [`lib/banks.ts`](../lib/banks.ts); every
format there has a synthetic fixture in `tests/bank-layouts.ts` that must read with a continuous balance. Besides those: **SWIFT
MT940** from any bank (`.txt`, `.sta`, `.940`, `.mt940`; several accounts become sections), and any CSV/TSV/XLSX/XLS with tanggal /
keterangan / debet-kredit (or mutasi, with a D/K column or a CR/DB marker in the amount) / saldo columns. `.xls` may be old Excel or
an HTML table saved as .xls (common in internet-banking exports); the kind is read from the bytes, not the name. Combined PDFs with
several accounts (e.g. SMBC "Laporan Konsolidasi Rekening") print one block per account; each is checked on its own and the
import takes the section whose number matches the selected bank account. Foreign-currency sections are listed but not imported.

**Accountants' working copies** are read as they are: one sheet per month (joined into one import when the sheets print the
same account number or none), `SALDO AWAL` rows, an unlabeled column with the transaction type, a formula balance. Two
choices are made from the file and shown as notes (`Catatan` here, *Cara file dibaca* in the app, kept in the import history):
- **Year.** `dd/MM` dates take the year from the file (a period line, a sheet name like "MEI 2026"). If the file has none,
  the import asks for the year of the first month, prefilled from the file name when it holds one; Des → Jan rolls forward.
- **Direction.** Debet is read as money out (the bank's side) unless only debet = money in (the books' side) makes the
  running balance continuous.

Not supported: scanned PDFs (no text layer) and password-protected Excel files. Both get a clear message.

**If a format fails**, send only the column header line and one anonymised row from `--lines`, with amounts and names
changed. That's enough to add the layout.

## 2. Add the client
Navigasi → **Daftar klien** → **Tambah klien**. Enter the client (group) name and business type, then one entity per company or person
with its own books (PT/CV first, then the owner) and its **Mata uang pembukuan** (IDR unless it keeps books in e.g. SGD).
Add each bank account with its number as printed on the statement; tick **PRK** for an overdraft loan account (its balance
is a debt to the bank). An entity whose books come from a ledger file needs no bank account: remove the row.
Imports refuse a file whose account number doesn't match.

## 3. Saldo awal
You land on **Saldo Awal** after saving. The date is the day before the first statement you'll import. If you import
first, bank lines are prefilled from that statement's opening balance, and time deposits the statement lists (SMBC *Detail
Produk Deposito*) are proposed on 1260 — change the account or remove the line. If the statements hold loan instalments or
drawdowns, the page reminds you to enter the loan balance. Add receivables, fixed assets, loans and capital if you have them.
The difference goes to 3200 Saldo Laba. One opening entry per entity; later corrections go through
Jurnal Penyesuaian.

## 4. Import → review → close
Same flow as the demo: **Impor Mutasi** (PDF asks for its password) → **Review** → **Laporan Keuangan** → **Tutup Buku**.
The controls show whether the books match the bank:
- *Rekonsiliasi* compares the statement's closing balance with the GL. It fails until Saldo Awal is posted.
- *Kelengkapan mutasi* shows the continuity result.
- *Kliring 1199* stays open until both sides of a transfer between own accounts are imported.

## 5. Ledger or Neraca from the client's old system (Jurnal, Accurate, Excel)
**Impor → Buku besar / neraca**. XLSX, XLS or CSV. A ledger needs tanggal, kode/nama akun, debit, kredit (optional: entitas,
no. bukti, mata uang, kurs, notes with `Rate: 1.31`). A Neraca needs kode/nama akun and saldo (Jurnal's export works as is). A Laba Rugi or arus kas export is refused with a message
saying so: the year-to-date result is already in the Neraca's saldo laba.
1. **Periksa file.** Nothing is posted yet. Choose the sheet if the file holds several tables.
2. **Pemeriksaan file.** BLOCK items stop the import: fix the file, or for an unbalanced journal *Terima & catat selisih ke 1999*
   (the difference stays visible in 1999 and fails Tutup Buku until a Jurnal Penyesuaian moves it). REVIEW items (codes reused
   with another name, foreign lines without a rate, balances against the account's nature) show up as a close control.
3. **Pemetaan akun.** Each account in the file keeps its own code and maps to one Buku account. Rule suggestions are filled in
   after upload; *Minta saran AI* sends only account codes, names and types (never amounts). Nothing counts until you accept it.
4. **Catat.** All journals post together, or none. Check **Neraca Saldo → Akun sumber** against the client's own TB.

From Google Drive: **Dokumen → Tambahkan dokumen → Baca folder** reads the same sheets; confirm each postable sheet as
Sumber pencatatan (multi-entity ledgers via *Sesuai kolom Entitas di file*, Neraca with its date) and **Siapkan impor** opens the
same draft. Keep the folder small (one workbook) — see [evidence workspace](evidence-workspace.md).

Currency: *Jumlah sudah dalam mata uang entitas* posts the amounts as written (default, faithful to the file).
*Konversi dengan kurs* converts foreign lines with the rate in the file, else the **Kurs** page on that date. The same choice
(**Baris valas**) appears in Dokumen for a confirmed ledger sheet with foreign rows; to switch after preparing, *Batalkan draf*
and prepare again. A journal that balances in each of its source currencies posts its conversion rounding (≤ 1 minor unit per
converted line) to 7190; any larger gap is a difference in the file and must be accepted into 1999 or fixed.

## 6. Kurs and Gabungan Grup in Rupiah
Entities in another currency are translated for the Gabungan: assets & liabilities at the month's closing rate, income &
expense at the year's average rate, equity at the historical rate; the difference is *Selisih penjabaran mata uang asing*.
The **Kurs** page lists every rate that's still missing; a report without its rates says *belum dijabarkan* instead of
showing a number. Rates are typed in (or taken from the imported file); Buku never fetches them. A rate written in a file only
fills a date the Kurs table doesn't have yet: it never replaces an existing rate (the table is shared by every client of the
firm). When the file's rate differs, the draft lists it under *Perlu dicek* (`Kurs … di file berbeda dari tabel Kurs …`).
Foreign balances (lines imported with a rate) are revalued at month end on **Tutup Buku → Catat revaluasi**.

## 7. Check a real file end to end (local only)
```bash
npm run verify:real -- chickin      # or goers | smbc | all; add --into-app to load it into the firm the app shows
```
Imports the files in `data/private/` into a fresh client and compares Buku with the files themselves; the report goes to
`data/private/reports/` (never commit it). Rates for the Gabungan come from `data/private/rates.csv`
(`currency,quote,date,kind,rate,note`).

## Environments
| Where | How to open | Database |
|---|---|---|
| Local | `npm run dev` with `.env` → `postgresql://buku:buku@localhost:5432/buku` and `DEMO_MODE=false` | local `buku` |
| Production (real workspace) | https://native-erp-v2.vercel.app (invitation login) | Supabase `native-erp-v2` |

New work merges into `main` after CI passes, and each merge deploys production. There is no staging ([ADR 0015](adrs/0015-production-only.md)). See [Branch workflow](../README.md#branch-workflow).

Google OAuth for Drive must list the production callback URL.

Never point `.env` at the production database, because `npm run demo:reset` truncates whatever `DATABASE_URL` points at;
local `.env` uses the local Supabase stack's Auth (`npm run auth:local`), never production's.
